# Notes from [Intro to Building on Eth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l9ohUBaxPk)
- Think algorithmically, tinkering on Solidity to show how to start thinking about building on Ethereum
- BuidlGuidl - DAO focused on dev onboarding, being the first step to get building on Eth
- Scaffold Eth - opinionated stack, allows you to build a website in an hour, makes a lot predetermined decisions for you to make things easy -> to buuild consumer apps
- `yarn chain` - spins up a local blockchain, has a bunch of accounts with eth in it, we can use locally, sort of the backend
- `yarn deploy` - deploys example smart contract to the blockchain
- `yarn start` - starts the frontend

## Intro info
- nextjs - frontend
- hardhat - smarth contracts
- yarn - npm (package manager) replacement - these are all using node -> yarn is a package manager that helps run things
- three layers, front end (nodejs), back end (solidity), blockchain
- this uses a mono repo -> multiple repos inside one
- Open ` http://localhost:3000 `

## Burner wallets
- Instead of MM, burner wallet generated automatically -> helps with testing to make quick transactions
